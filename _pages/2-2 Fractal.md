<h1><a href="/ui/uc/fractal/" style="color: inherit; text-decoration: none;">Fractal geometry</a></h1>

Fractal geometry is an opposite concept to classical or Euclidean geometry in that it deals with structures that have complexity at all scales, unlike Euclidean geometry where shapes like points, lines, and planes have well-defined and deterministic properties, such as finite area or volume. One of the most famous fractals is the coast of Britain. Unlike regular patterns like triangle, rectangel or circle, the length of a coastline can vary dramatically depending on the scale at which it is measured. (see Introduction for details).

## What a fractal looks like?
Before the notion of fractal formally discovered in nature or built environment, humans had already been trying to create patterns and structures that exhibited complexity or had infinite length. The first group of people to show great interest in these complex patterns were mathematicians.

### Cantor set
The concept of the Cantor set was introduced by the German-Russian mathematician ***Georg Cantor*** in the late 19th century. It is constructed by starting with a line segment (the largest interval), and then repeatedly dividing each remaining segment into three equal parts, removing the middle third each time. Cantor was deeply interested in the nature of infinity and wanted to understand different types of infinite sets. At the time, it was widely believed that all infinities were the same size, but Cantor showed that there are different sizes of infinity. The Cantor set, while uncountably infinite, has a counterintuitive property: it contains infinitely many points, yet its total length (in the traditional sense) is zero.

<br>Similar to the coastline of Britain, the Cantor set shows infinite detail, making its total length unmeasurable in the traditional sense. The infinite complexity of the Cantor set arises from the process of repeated iterations—each step involves removing the middle third of each remaining segment. With each iteration, the set becomes more intricate, but crucially, the pattern self-repeats at every scale.
