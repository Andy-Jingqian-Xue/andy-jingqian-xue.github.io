Geovisualization is a discipline that leverages visual tools to analyze and design functional, aesthetically appealing visualizations for effectively communicating and interpreting geographical data. A key challenge in this field is how to create visually compelling designs that leave a lasting impression on users. Yet, there is no definitive answer to this question.

Architect Mies van der Rohe's famous phrase "less is more" embodies a design philosophy that applies across many domains, particularly in logo design, as seen with University College London and Starbucks (Figure 1, a and b). These designs are regarded as successful because they distill the key elements, removing unnecessary details. Another example comes from Henri Matisse's self-portraits (1947) and his statement, "exactitude is not truth." His four drawings, composed of simple sketches rather than detailed paintings, effectively capture his likeness, proving that simplicity can communicate more than excessive precision (Figure 1, c).

In contrast, many people advocate the idea that "less is a bore." Supporters of this philosophy, including Donald Trump, have argued that federal buildings should adhere to classical architectural styles as the default standard, as traditional Western architecture has long been celebrated for its grandeur, intricacy, and luxury. Despite these differing perspectives, both viewpoints highlight an inherent scaling hierarchy that underlies beauty (Figure 2). Meaningful and trivial elements are hierarchically organized. The notion that "less is a bore" does not equate to "more is more," but rather suggests that there is a structured order with an inherent hierarchy governing design and complexity. This hierarchy possesses a mathematical characteristic, where there are far more smalls than larges, a phenomenon that can be analyzed through algorithms such as head/tail breaks. In this course, the concept of hierarchy will guide us toward creating more appealing designs and visualizations of urban data. Moreover, it is one of the fundamental properties of Christopher Alexander's living structure, serving as both a means to understand the beauty of design and a way to enhance it.
