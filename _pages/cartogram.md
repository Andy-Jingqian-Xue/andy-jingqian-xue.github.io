# The cartogram of global natural cities
The cartogram is generated based on the geographic distribution of natural cities around the world, representing their sizes and spatial relationships according to specific data metrics, such as population or land area. In other words, countries with a larger number of natural cities will appear enlarged, while countries with fewer natural cities will be reduced in size. Thus, we can see that the United States is enlarged, while Africa is minimized. If you are interested in this visualization, please refer to the original article in the references.
